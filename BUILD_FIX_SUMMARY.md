# Build Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `Type error: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'MuiDataGrid' does not exist in type 'Components<Omit<Theme, "components">>'.`

## Root Cause
The `MuiDataGrid` component styling was included in the Material-UI theme configuration, but `MuiDataGrid` is not part of the core Material-UI package. It's from the `@mui/x-data-grid` package and cannot be styled through the main theme's components object.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed MuiDataGrid from Theme Files
- Removed `MuiDataGrid` styling from both `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` in `app/theme.ts`
- This eliminates the TypeScript compilation error

### 2. Created Separate DataGrid Theme File
- Created `app/dataGridTheme.ts` with DataGrid-specific styling
- Provides both light and dark theme variants
- Can be imported and used when DataGrid components are needed

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with the fix details
- Added troubleshooting section for Material-UI component styling issues

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/theme.ts` - Removed MuiDataGrid styling
- ✅ `app/dataGridTheme.ts` - Created separate DataGrid theme
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Updated with fix documentation

## Result
- ✅ TypeScript compilation now passes
- ✅ Build process completes successfully
- ✅ Deployment should work without errors
- ✅ DataGrid styling preserved in separate file for future use

## Usage for DataGrid Components
When using DataGrid components in the future:

```typescript
import { dataGridStyles } from '@/app/dataGridTheme'

// In your component
<DataGrid
  sx={dataGridStyles.light} // or dataGridStyles.dark
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Next Steps
The application should now deploy successfully. The build process will complete without TypeScript errors, and all functionality remains intact.
